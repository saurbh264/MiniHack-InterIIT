## Problem Statements

### 1. PS-1: Google Lens Pro Max
The goal is to develop an intelligent pipeline that takes an image of any object along with a user-defined prompt as input. The prompt specifies the user's requirement, such as finding similar objects or variations based on the image.

### 2. PS-2: HogRAGger
The goal is to develop a RAG pipeline that would answer the userâ€™s question from the given corpus. The queries would require evidence from 2 to 4 documents and may also require information from document metadata in order to be answered. The output of your pipeline should be formatted the same as outputs in train.json
